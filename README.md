1. Instruction

1) Create Java Project named ‚Äú2110215_Midterm_Q1‚Äù.

2) Copy all folders in ‚ÄúQ1.zip‚Äù to your project directory src folder.

3) You are to implement the following classes (detail for each class is given in section 4)

a) Region (package logic)

b) Database (package logic)

4) JUnit for testing is in package test.grader 5) To submit:

5.1. go to src folder that you actually do the coding for this question.

5.2. Zip this question‚Äôs src folder. Name it YOUR-ID_Q1.zip (for example, 6332112121_Q1.zip)

5.3. Submit the zipped file as an assignment on MyCourseville.

2. Problem Statement: CPQuest

You are tasked to finish the backbone code for a ‚ÄúQuest‚Äù system for a game. The demo for the system (result from running Main in package main) is shown in section 6. But it is not necessary to know the demo to write the backbone code of the program.

3. Implementation Detail

The class package is summarized below.

‚Äì 3 (7500 &lt; score &lt;= 10000)

‚Äì 2 (5000 &lt; score &lt;= 7500)

‚Äì 1 (2500 &lt; score &lt;= 5000)

‚Äì 0 (score &lt;= 2500)

+ remaining getter/setter for each field

4.1.4 Class Region: This class represent a single region. It contains all data related to the region, including the quest list within the region. You must create this class from scratch.

Field

Name Description

‚Äì String name The name of the Region.

‚Äì ArrayList&lt;Player&gt; playerList An ArrayList containing all Player in this Region.

‚Äì ArrayList&lt;Quest&gt; questList An ArrayList containing all Quest in this Region.

Constructor

Name Description

+ Region(String name) Create a Region with the specified name.

Initialized the ArrayList for both playerList and questList

Method

Name Description

+ void setName(String name) Set the name of the Region.

If the name is blank (Can be checked using name.isBlank()), set it to ‚ÄúNowhere‚Äù

+ int getPlayerCount() Return the size of the playerList

+ double getRegionRank() Return the average rank of all players in the region. (Continued next page)

The average rank can be obtained by summation of the rank of every player in the region, then divide by the total numbers of the player in the region. Please round the number to 2 decimal points

+ ArrayList&lt;Quest&gt; getAvailableQuests(Player viewer) Return an ArrayList of all Quest in the region that have the status AVAILABLE.

Do note that the viewer must not be able to view the quest that belongs to himself/herself.

+ void

addPlayerToRegion(Player p) Add Player to the playerList

+ void

addQuestToRegion(Quest q) Add Quest to the questList

+ remaining getter/setter for each field

4.1.5 Class DatabaseUtil: This class represents the utility function that has been partially implemented. It contains useful functions you can use to help implementing the Database.

/*ALREADY PROVIDED*/

Method

Name Description

+ boolean isPlayerExists(ArrayList&lt;Player&gt; playerList, String name) Return true if the Player with the given name already exists in the playerList.

+ boolean isRegionExists(ArrayList&lt;Region&gt; regionList, String name) Return true if the Region with the given name already exists in the regionList.

4.1.6 Class Database: This class represents the database. It contains all the frontend-backend communications, as well as the players and region list.

*For simplicity reasons for the Exam, we have used standard Exception here. In real-life scenario, please create a more specific exception for each scenario. *

5. Program Demonstration

Figure 2: The Initial Screen

First off, as a guest. You can either log in or viewing the statistic. Once you logged in, you will have more options to work with. We will cover the statistics option later.

Once you picked the log in option, you will be presented with the current user list in the system, or you can choose to make the new one. Do note that the new username cannot be the same as the one in the database. If it happened, the system would alert the user.

Figure 3: Registering new player

Once you logged in, the start menu changed, and you can access more option.

Figure 4: New Start Menu once logged in

For the first option, you can edit your own username, do note that the same restriction as when registering new player applies.

Figure 5. Submenu for editing username

The next option is ‚ÄúTake On a Quest‚Äù. You can take on a quest using this option. The system will prompt you to pick the region and will display the current available quest in that region.

Figure 6. Take On a Quest

Do note that this option will be changed to Manage Quest Status instead when you have taken a quest. With Manage Quest Status menu, you can mark the quest as finished or decline the quest. By marking the quest as finished, you will obtain the score reward from the quest equal to the quest‚Äôs rank.

Figure 7. Manage Quest Status

The third option is for posting your own quest. Everything here should be selfexplanatory.

Figure 8. Posting Quest Option

Finally, the last option is for viewing the status of the region. It displays the player count and average rank of the players in the region.
